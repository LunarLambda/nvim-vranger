# vranger - Rich Ranger Integration for Neovim

WIP

It:

1. Uses a python integration script to add neovim-specific commands to ranger
   without needing to touch the user's configuration files
2. Uses pipes to communicate with ranger directly and asynchronously

Currently implemented:

- [ ] Commands (:Ex and friends)
- [ ] Netrw-dropin (FileExplorer autocmds)
- [ ] Keybindings
- [ ] Most of the things you want from a neovim plugin
